# PGDVisualisation

## Overview

Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks are a type of adversarial attack used to test the robustness of machine learning models. This repository contains visualization tools to help researchers explain and understand PGD attacks.

## To-Do List

1. **Modify PlotCosineSimilarityGradExample**
    - Use actual X and Y data from the PCAClass plot.
    - Modify the radius of the ring plotted to map perturbations of an input.

2. **Replicate PlotCosineSimilarityGradExample as a Web Interface**
    - Create a web interface where green, yellow, and blue points are draggable objects that update the graph in real-time.

## Getting Started

To get started with the visualization tools, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PGDVisualisation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd PGDVisualisation
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
